# Computational-Method-Homework
This course was given in autumn 2020 by Professor Kuan Xu, USTC and focus on basic knowledge of Numerical Analysis and Numerical Linear Algebra. Though Professor Xu pays much efforts to teaching and thus will renew his coding homework every year, I still have to inform you guys that copying codes in homework is unacceptable. Wish you have a happy life :).
